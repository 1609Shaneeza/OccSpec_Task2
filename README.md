This is a prototype for a Safari Style Zoo, you could open the files on codespaces

you need python installed on your computer to run the backend code and also node.js installed on your computer.

certain file paths needs to be changed inorder to run the code or else it would not be function the background image urls needs to be changed this includes copying the file path of the greenbackgroung image in the assets folder. 

you need to change the file path for the database in the backend by copying the filepath of the database when running the code.

when running the code on codeSpaces you need to change and move up to 1 directory to run the front end:
to do this you should type:  cd task2_frontend   in a new terminal and then:
npm run dev
